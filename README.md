# JS Readings
These are all my humble attempts at any tasks I see during a JavaScript Reading.
If you would like to view my code, and test the tasks for yourself: 
1. Each reading is it's own document folder
2. I use better comments extension on vs code for organising multiple tasks within one js file
3. it's mostly commented out, only uncomment one section/task at a time (clearly defined by my comments) for each task to run properly
