# JS Readings
These are all my humble attempts at any tasks I see during a JavaScript Reading.
#### If you would like to view my code, and test the tasks for yourself: 
1. Each js reading has it's own document folder within this repo
2. I use 'better comments' extension on vs code ~ for organising multiple tasks, within a js file
3. It's mostly commented out; only uncomment one section/task at a time (clearly defined by my comments) for each task to run properly
